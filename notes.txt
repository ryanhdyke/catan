Additions: trade ins (4-1s)
           dev cards
           ports
           trading between players
           longest road and largest army

Minor/cosmetic fixes: dice simulator (mayber have it be a button similar to endturn and when clicked a little animation)
                      make hitboxes bigger for some spots and items
                      clean up/organize bottom right general info area
                      make moving robber look better (so it doesnt snap to cursor when 7 is rolled)
                      make robber bigger so when it's placed it covers the number/looks good
                      make it so the second road in starting phase can only be placed on the second settlement
                      update check for win to show who actually won
                      maybe move default road positions up a little to get them a little more centered

Bugs: none currently noticed

maybe instead of a box with the buildings in it, have a button for settlement, city, and road and when pressed,
the building goes to your cursor and you can place it
    Pros: dont have to check if you are picking up a building by coordinates
    Cons: have to redo a lot of the picking up a building logic
          tried but cant get it to work


Turn steps:
currplayer rolls dice
everyone collects resources (or performs actions for a 7 rolled)
currplayer can build given they meet the requirements
currplayer can trade with anyone
currplayer ends turn
